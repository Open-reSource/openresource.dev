<p class="lead">You are finally ready to share your GitHub action with the world. You have spent hours working on it, and now it is time to show it off. You open your favorite social media platform, start typing your post, link your project, click on send, and... your big face is on people's screen!</p>

This is what happened to me when I shared the marketplace link of my GitHub action.

To be fair, the rendering is different if ones shares a link to the GitHub project itself.

## What Can We Do About It?

It is possible to add a social preview image to your GitHub project. This image will be used when you share the link to your project on social media platforms. Note that this image will be used when the project or the marketplace link is shared.

It is rather easy to do, everything is explained in the GitHub documentation [Customizing your repository's social media preview](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview).

At the times of writing, images are recommended to be 1280x640px for best display on high-resolution devices.

It is not visible in the documentation but in the settings of your repository, but GitHub provides a template for the social preview image which is pretty handy to get started and to have the safe zones.

I am not a designer, so I used the template to create my social preview image which has the following rendering:

<img src="/images/Update issue body.png" alt="" class="border" />

## How To Check If It Works?

After having uploaded the image to your repository, you can check if it works by using online tools like [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/).

Whether you use the marketplace link or the project link, you should see the social preview image.

## Find This Template On Figma

Based on this rendering, I have created a template on Figma that you can use to create your own social preview image.

TODO: create the template and share the link.
