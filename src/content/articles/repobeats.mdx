<p class="lead">[Repobeats](https://repobeats.axiom.co/) is a tool that provides analytics of a GitHub repository that can be embedded in any Markdown file; including its README file.</p>

It is completely free and maintained by [axiom.com](https://axiom.co/), but does not seem to be an open-source project as it is not referenced in [github.com/axiomhq](https://github.com/axiomhq).

This service allows to give a visual representation of the activity of your GitHub repository:
- the number of contributions in the last 30 days
- the number of opened/closed issues ratio with an associated bar chart of the past month
- the number of PRs opened with an associated bar chart of the past month
- the number of commits with an associated bar chart of the past month
- the top contributors with their GitHub green square activity; their contribution heatmap

It can be a great way to show the activity of your GitHub repository and encourage people to contribute, but also to celebrate your top contributors.

Behind the scene, Repobeats uses public data available on GitHub.

## Installation

Installing Repobeats requires a GitHub account.

<div role="alert" class="alert alert-warning">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="stroke-current shrink-0 h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M12 9v2m0 4h.01m-6.938 4h13.856c1.54 0 2.502-1.667 1.732-3L13.732 4c-.77-1.333-2.694-1.333-3.464 0L3.34 16c-.77 1.333.192 3 1.732 3z" /></svg>
  <span>**Warning:** Please consult their [Frequency Asked Questions](https://repobeats.axiom.co/) for more information before installing it. They explain for example how they use your email address.</span>
</div>

To install Repobeats, it is pretty straightforward:

1. Go to https://repobeats.axiom.co/
2. Login with your GitHub account
3. Select the owner and repository you want to analyze

And that's it! You will get a URL like ours that you can use in your README file or any Markdown file:

```markdown
// Add the following to your README.md to embed Repobeats

```

## Rendering

Here is what it looks like for our [openresource.dev GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-reSource/openresource.dev):

And here is the same kind of data, but on a more active repository like freeCodeCamp:

<ProjectThumbnail env="freeCodeCamp" repo="freeCodeCamp" img="9892522" description="freeCodeCamp.org's open-source codebase and curriculum. Learn to code for free." />

freeCodeCamp is using it in the ["Contributing" section of their README file](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) and it looks great!

We can see right away that this repository is very active with a lot of contributions, issues, PRs, and commits.
