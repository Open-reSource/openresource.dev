<p class="lead">A simple nice way to reward your sponsors could be to showcase them in the projects you create on GitHub. And what a better place to do that than in your READMEs? This article will show you how to do that easily!</p>

There are several ways to display your sponsors in your GitHub READMEs, but this article will focus on a single one by using [SponsorKit](https://github.com/antfu/sponsorkit) created by [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu).

    <p>ðŸ’– Toolkit for generating sponsors images ðŸ˜„</p>
  </div>
</div>

**SponsorKit** is a toolkit for generating sponsors images that supports GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, Patreon, and Afdian.

Here's how Anthony uses it himself in [antfu/unplugin-auto-import README](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import#sponsors).

Let's do our own sponsors image showcasing our GitHub sponsors!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have a GitHub account and have at least one sponsor.

Then, you will need to create a new GitHub personal access token (classic) with the `read:org`, and `read:user` scopes that you can name whatever you want, and keep its value somewhere for the next steps of this tutorial.

You can find more information about how to create a GitHub token in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Create Your Repository

In order to facilitate the process, we have created for you a template repository that you can use to create your own repository: https://github.com/Open-reSource/sponsorkit-starter.

<div class="card w-full bg-base-100 xs:shadow-xl mb-12 xs:mb-0 not-prose">
  <div class="card-body p-0 xs:p-8 list-none">
    <div class="flex justify-between">
      <h2 class="card-title text-xl xs:text-4xl text-base-content">
        <a href="https://github.com/Open-reSource/sponsorkit-starter" class="stretched-link hover:underline font-normal break-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          <span class="max-w-[50px]">Open-reSource/</span><br/>
          <strong class="font-bold max-w-[50px]">sponsorkit-starter</strong>
        </a>

    </div>
    <p>Starter template for SponsorKit</p>
  </div>
</div>

### From the Starter Template

You can click on the "Use this template" button to create your own repository.

Then, you will need to fill the form with the name of your repository, a description, and choose if you want to make it public or private. Click on the "Create repository from template" button to create your repository.

It will launch a GitHub Action that will fail, but don't worry, we will fix that in the next steps.

### From a New Repository

It is also possible to create your repository from scratch, clone it locally, and then running the following command:

```sh
npx degit Open-reSource/sponsorkit-starter
```

## Configure Your Repository

Your new repository is now created, and should contain the following files:

* `.github/workflows/scheduler.yml` that runs the SponsorKit action on a schedule every day, for each merge on the main branch, or manually.
* `.env.example` as described in [SponsorKit usage](https://github.com/antfu/sponsorkit/#usage).
* `build.sh` script to generate the sponsors images.
* `package.json` relying on the latest version of SponsorKit and containing the build script.
* `sponsor.config.ts` that contains the configuration for the generation of the sponsors images.

### Change Default Permissions of GITHUB_TOKEN

First important thing to do is to change the default permissions of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that is used by the GitHub Action to commit and push the generated sponsors images.

It can be changed by going to your repository settings, then to the "Actions" section, and choose "Read an write permissions" for the "Workflow permissions" option.

You can find more information about this configuration in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions).

### Set up the environment variable

By looking at `.github/worfklows/scheduler.yml`, we can see that it relies on a `${{ secrets.SPONSORS_TOKEN }}` environment variable.

We will need to set it up in the GitHub repository settings with "SPONSORS_TOKEN" as a name, and with the value of the GitHub personal access token that we have created in the prerequisites.

You can find more information about how to create a new repository secret in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Configure the GitHub Action

Either after having cloned your repository locally, or directly on GitHub, you will need to edit the `.github/worfklows/scheduler.yml` to indicate your GitHub username as a value for "SPONSORKIT_GITHUB_LOGIN".

Commit and push your changes.

## Check Your Generated Images

This latter change will trigger the GitHub Action that will generate your sponsors images, commit, and push them at the root level of your repository with the message _" chore: update sponsors.svg"_.

For example, you can see the generated sponsors images of the [julien-deramond/static](https://github.com/julien-deramond/static) repository created from this same template.

## (Optional) Generate The Images Locally
<details>
<summary>More information</summary>

It might be useful to know, even if rarely useful, it is also possible to run it locally.

You will need to install the dependencies by running `npm i` in your terminal.

Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env` still at the root level of your repository with the following content:

```
; GitHub provider.
; Token requires the `read:user` and `read:org` scopes.
SPONSORKIT_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SPONSORKIT_GITHUB_LOGIN=username
```

* `SPONSORKIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` is the GitHub token you created earlier.
* `SPONSORKIT_GITHUB_LOGIN` is your GitHub username.


The final step is to run `npm run build` in your terminal to generate the static files:

```sh
ju ß· ~/j/static âž¤ (main) npm run build                                                                                                                                                          	(0.060674 hrs)

All the images are now generated at the root level of your repository. You can check them out in your file explorer.

**Warning**: Once it's done, please don't forget to remove at some point your GitHub token from the `.env` file for security reasons. You won't probably never re-run it from your local machine.
</details>

## Use the Generated Images in Your READMEs

Now that the GitHub Action has run, you can use the generated images in your READMEs.

For example, you can use the `sponsors.svg` image in your `README.md` file by adding (replace `username` by your GitHub username):

```html
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/static/sponsors.svg">
	<img src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/static/sponsors.svg'/>
  </a>
</p>
```

**Warning**: GitHub can take a while to render the image in your README. If you don't see it, wait and refresh the page. On my side, it took around 10 minutes to be displayed. As long as the `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/static/sponsors.svg` URL is showing the image, don't worry, it will be displayed in your README soon.

## Final Result

We don't have (yet) any sponsors specifically for Open &lcub;re&rcub;Source, so you can check my own personal sponsors list generated by following this article:

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/julien-deramond/static/sponsors.svg" alt="Julien DÃ©ramond sponsors list" />

And find it integrated in one of my projects: https://github.com/julien-deramond/update-issue-body#sponsors.
