<p class="lead">Open Source is a collaborative development methodology and philosophy that is changing the way in which not just software but various forms of technology, art, and knowledge are developed and shared.</p>

It refers to software or other products whose code or design is freely accessible and can be modified and distributed by anyone. Open Source software is typically developed by a community of contributors who work together to identify bugs, add features, and improve the overall quality of the project. By fostering collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development, Open Source encourages innovation and leads to better and more reliable products.
