## Crowdfunding Campaigns

As mentioned in the previous chapter, crowdfunding has become a popular method for raising funds for several types of projects, including open-source initiatives. Platforms allow project creators to present their ideas to a wide audience and raise small, or large, amounts of money from a large number of people.

Here are some platforms that you can use to launch your crowdfunding campaign:

- [GoFundMe](https://gofundme.com)
- [Indiegogo](https://indiegogo.com)
- [Kickstarter](https://kickstarter.com)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com)

### Best Practices

When launching a crowdfunding campaign, consider the following best practices to maximize your chances of success:

- **Compelling Story**: Craft a compelling narrative about your project. Explain why it matters, what problem it solves, its impact, and why people should support it.
- **Transparent Goals**: Clearly outline your funding goals, how the money will be used, and what backers can expect in return.
- **Engaging Media**: Use high-quality images, videos, and other media to showcase your project, make your campaign more appealing, and engage potential backers.
- **Rewards and Incentives**: Offer attractive rewards for different levels of contributions, such as early access to the software or some exclusive features in beta versions, or project merchandise.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your backers informed with regular updates on the progress of the project, milestones achieved, and challenges faces. Transparency builds trust and credibility.

### Examples of Successful Campaigns

Several open-source projects have successfully leveraged crowdfunding campaigns to raise funds and engage their communities. Here are a few examples:

* **[Krita](https://krita.org)**, a free and open-source cross-platform digital painting application, [raised over €30,000 on Kickstarter in 2015 to fund the development](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot). You can check out their campaign for inspiration, and see how they structured their rewards and communicated with their backers. It allowed them to have a successful campaign with almost 1,000 backers and exceed their initial funding goal that was set at €20,000.

* **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)**, a free and open-source game engine, also used crowdfunding to fund their development with Patreon. You can find their Patreon journey at the end of 2018 described in [this blog post](https://patreon.com/posts/our-patreon-so-22847235), but also some [data regarding their Patreon donations on Graphtreon](https://graphtreon.com/creator/godotengine).
Their past crowdfunding campaigns can be found online in several places with interesting blog post like [Godot Patreon and goals updated, help us hire Pedro Estébanez](https://godotengine.org/article/future-patreon-and-donations/). It can be a great source of inspiration to see how they managed to raise funds and engage with their community, what kind of steps they took to reach their goals, and more.

  What's also interesting is that Godot Engine switched from Patreon to their own platform: [Godot Development Fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/). You can find more information about the reasons behind this move in [this blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/).
