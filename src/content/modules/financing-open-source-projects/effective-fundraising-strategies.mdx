<p class="lead">Securing funding is crucial for the sustainability and growth of open-source projects. While many projects start as volunteer-driven initiatives, obtaining financial support can be a game-changer and significantly enhance their development, maintenance, and impact.</p>

This chapter explores various fundraising strategies that open-source projects can leverage to ensure their long-term viability. From crowdfunding campaigns, to sponsorships and partnerships, to grants and foundations, passing through membership, subscription models, and more, there are multiple ways to secure funding for your project.

## Donations

You probably already know that donations are a common way to fund open-source projects. In fact, many open-source projects rely on direct donations from their user base. They can come from individuals, companies, or other organizations that want to support your work.

Donations can be one-time or recurring, and they can be facilitated through platforms like:

- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
- [PayPal](https://paypal.com)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com)

### Best Practices

When setting up a donation system for your project, consider the following best practices:

- **Easy Access**: Make it easy for users to find and use your donation options. Prominently display donation buttons on your repositories, website, documentation, social media, or even within the software itself.
- **Transparency**: Clearly explain how donations will be used. Provide detailed reports or updates on how the funds are being spent.
- **Recognition**: Publicly acknowledge donors, either on your repositories, website, in documentation, or within the software itself.
- **Engagement**: Engage with your donors regularly. Send them updates on the project's progress, milestones achieved, or upcoming features.

### Example of Successful Donation Fundraising

**[Blender](https://blender.org/)**, a popular open-source 3D creation software, relies on donations to fund its development. [The Blender Foundation](https://blender.org/about/foundation/) accepts donations through their website, their [Development Fund](https://fund.blender.org/), and provides transparency by regularly updating donors on how the funds are being used.

At the time of writing, the numbers are impressive with almost €165,000 monthly donations, around 4,500 individual supporters, and around 40 corporate supporters. You can find live information about their donations on their [donation page](https://fund.blender.org/).

## Sponsorships

Sponsorships are another effective way to secure funding for open-source projects. Companies or organizations can sponsor your project by providing financial support, resources, or services. In return, they can receive various benefits, such as exposure, recognition, or access to your project's community.

The first step in securing sponsorships is to **identify potential sponsors** that have a vested interest in your project. This could be tech companies, non-profits, educational institutions, or government agencies.

Then, you can craft a **sponsorship proposal**:
1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce your project and its objectives.
2. **Value Proposition**: Explain the benefits of sponsoring your project. Highlight how it aligns with the sponsor's goals or interests.
3. **Sponsorship Tiers**: Offer different levels of sponsorship with corresponding benefits. For example, mention levels like bronze, silver, and gold, each providing increasing levels of exposure and involvement.
4. **Metrics and Impact**: Provide data or projections on the reach and impact of your project.

**Maintaining relationships** with sponsors is crucial to ensure their continued support:
- **Regular Communication**: Keep sponsors informed about the project's progress.
- **Recognition**: Publicly acknowledge sponsors on your project's website, documentation, and promotional materials.
- **Reports and Updates**: Provide detailed reports on how the sponsorship funds are being used and the impact they are making.

### Examples of Sponsorship Programs

The **[Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/foundation/sponsorship)** secures sponsorship from [major tech companies like Google and Microsoft](https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsors), which helps provide the infrastructure for hundreds of open-source projects (mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, etc.), but also running the foundation itself.

We talked about levels of sponsorship earlier, and the Apache Software Foundation has a [page dedicated to their sponsorship levels](https://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship#foundation-sponsorship) with different levels of sponsorship and the benefits associated with each level, and we are talking big numbers here with the highest level of sponsorship starting at $125,000 per year.

If you are interested in detailed information about numbers, statistics, and actions taken by the Apache Software Foundation, you can check their [annual reports](https://apache.org/foundation/reports.html) that are publicly available.

## Crowdfunding Campaigns

As mentioned in the previous chapter, crowdfunding has become a popular method for raising funds for several types of projects, including open-source initiatives. Platforms allow project creators to present their ideas to a wide audience and raise small, or large, amounts of money from a large number of people.

Here are some platforms that you can use to launch your crowdfunding campaign:

- [GoFundMe](https://gofundme.com)
- [Indiegogo](https://indiegogo.com)
- [Kickstarter](https://kickstarter.com)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com)

### Best Practices

When launching a crowdfunding campaign, consider the following best practices to maximize your chances of success:

- **Compelling Story**: Craft a compelling narrative about your project. Explain why it matters, what problem it solves, its impact, and why people should support it.
- **Transparent Goals**: Clearly outline your funding goals, how the money will be used, and what backers can expect in return.
- **Engaging Media**: Use high-quality images, videos, and other media to showcase your project, make your campaign more appealing, and engage potential backers.
- **Rewards and Incentives**: Offer attractive rewards for different levels of contributions, such as early access to the software or some exclusive features in beta versions, or project merchandise.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your backers informed with regular updates on the progress of the project, milestones achieved, and challenges faces. Transparency builds trust and credibility.

### Examples of Successful Campaigns

Several open-source projects have successfully leveraged crowdfunding campaigns to raise funds and engage their communities. Here are a few examples:

* **[Krita](https://krita.org)**, a free and open-source cross-platform digital painting application, [raised over €30,000 on Kickstarter in 2015 to fund the development](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot). You can check out their campaign for inspiration, and see how they structured their rewards and communicated with their backers. It allowed them to have a successful campaign with almost 1,000 backers and exceed their initial funding goal that was set at €20,000.

* **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)**, a free and open-source game engine, also used crowdfunding to fund their development with Patreon. You can find their Patreon journey at the end of 2018 described in [this blog post](https://patreon.com/posts/our-patreon-so-22847235), but also some [data regarding their Patreon donations on Graphtreon](https://graphtreon.com/creator/godotengine).
Their past crowdfunding campaigns can be found online in several places with interesting blog post like [Godot Patreon and goals updated, help us hire Pedro Estébanez](https://godotengine.org/article/future-patreon-and-donations/). It can be a great source of inspiration to see how they managed to raise funds and engage with their community, what kind of steps they took to reach their goals, and more.

  What's also interesting is that Godot Engine switched from Patreon to their own platform: [Godot Development Fund](https://fund.godotengine.org/). You can find more information about the reasons behind this move in [this blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/).
