## Recognizing and Encouraging Contributors

There are various ways to recognize, encourage and appreciate your project's contributors.

### Achievements and Badges

Creating **a system of achievements** like [Astro Badges](https://astro.badg.es/) is a great way for your contributors to show off their contributions and achievements, or even celebrate the contributions and achievements of others. They can also serve as a form of motivation for contributors to continue contributing to your project and boost their morale. These badges can be added to GitHub profiles, HTML pages, and Markdown files. Here's mine for example:

[![@julien-deramond Astro contributions](https://astro.badg.es/v2/contributor/julien-deramond.svg)](https://astro.badg.es/contributor/julien-deramond/)

You can reproduce this system for your own project as [Chris Swithinbank](https://github.com/delucis) gratefully shared the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/delucis/astro-badge).
