<p class="lead">Bluesky released starter packs on June 26, 2024. They are personalized invites that allow users to bring people directly into your slice of Bluesky!</p>

[Bluesky](https://bsky.social), the decentralized social media platform, has recently introduced starter packs, aiming to personalize user experiences and make it easier for communities to grow. [On June 26, 2024, Bluesky launched these starter packs](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs), allowing users to bring friends directly into their customized Bluesky environment.

## What's in a Bluesky Starter Pack?

A Bluesky starter pack can include the following:

- **Custom feeds**: On Bluesky, you can set any algorithm or topic as your home timeline.
- **Recommended follows**: Add your favorite accounts and encourage new users to follow them.

At the time of writing:

- **Starter packs do not show up in search**, so you will need to have someone send you the link or see the embed preview within the Bluesky app.
- **Starter packs can recommend up to 150 people and up to 3 custom feeds**. New users will automatically have Following and Discover pinned.

## The Open Source Bluesky Starter Pack

You can count on us! The Open \{re\}Source team is excited to introduce **our very own Bluesky starter pack focused on open source**! ðŸš€

We followed the tutorial provided by Bluesky [in their blog post](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs), but even without the tutorial, it is quite easy and intuitive to create a starter pack from the interface.

Below is the link to our open source Bluesky starter pack:
