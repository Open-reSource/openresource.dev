	[contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks/) is a an online tool that generates an
	image of the top contributors of a GitHub repository that can be embedded in
	any website or Markdown file; including its README file.
</p>

It is completely free and maintained by Suguru Inatomi, a.k.a. [lacolaco](https://github.com/lacolaco). The source code is available on GitHub:

<ShowcaseGitHubRepo env="lacolaco" repo="contributors-img" img="1529180" />

This service allows to give a visual representation of the top contributors of any GitHub repository.

Generating such an image of your GitHub repository top contributors can be a great way to show the activity of your GitHub repository and encourage people to contribute, but also to celebrate your top contributors.

## How to Use

Usage is pretty straightforward:

1. Go to https://contrib.rocks/
2. Enter a GitHub repository (e.g., `open-reSource/openresource.dev`)

And that's it! You will get the image representing the top contributors of the GitHub repository you entered.

Then, you can click on the "Get Image URL!" button to get the Markdown code to embed the image in your README file for instance.

```md
<a href="https://github.com/open-reSource/openresource.dev/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=open-reSource/openresource.dev" />
</a>

Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).
```

You will notice that the first part of the generated Markdown code is in reality HTML code. You can use this HTML code to embed the image in any website or Markdown file.

## Rendering

Here is what it looks like for our [openresource.dev GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-reSource/openresource.dev):

---

<a href="https://github.com/open-reSource/openresource.dev/graphs/contributors">
	<img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=open-reSource/openresource.dev" />
</a>

Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).

And here is the same rendering, but on a more active repository like [godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot):

<ShowcaseGitHubRepo
	env="godotengine"
	repo="godot"
	img="6318500"
	description="Godot Engine â€“ Multi-platform 2D and 3D game engine"
/>

---

<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/graphs/contributors">
	<img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=godotengine/godot" />
</a>

Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).

Some parameters can be added to the URL to customize the image:

- `max={number}`: Max contributor count (100 by default)
- `columns={number}`: Max columns (12 by default)
- `anon={0|1}`: Include anonymous users (false by default)

So if we add `&max=10&columns=2` to the image URL `https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=godotengine/godot` we get the following image with only the top 10 contributors and 2 columns:

```md
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=godotengine/godot&max=10&columns=2" />
</a>

Made with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).
