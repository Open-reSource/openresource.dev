## Browser Extensions

- [Better GitHub Co-Authors](https://github.com/delucis/better-github-coauthors) by [Chris Swithinbank](https://github.com/delucis/) – Adds an "Add co-authors" button to the PR merge UI on GitHub, automatically collecting all participants and generating "Co-authored-by" comments for easy credit in the commit message—perfect for acknowledging reviewers and commenters, not just code contributors.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

- [Todoctor](https://github.com/azat-io/todoctor) by [Azat S.](https://github.com/azat-io) – Analyzes, tracks, and reports TODO comments within JavaScript and TypeScript Git repositories. Generates an informative chart categorizing TODOs by type, providing a visual representation of technical debt in your codebase. Additionally, it features a detailed table listing all occurrences of TODO comments.
