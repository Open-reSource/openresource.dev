- [Better GitHub Co-Authors](https://github.com/delucis/better-github-coauthors) by [Chris Swithinbank](https://github.com/delucis/) – Adds an "Add co-authors" button to the PR merge UI on GitHub, automatically collecting all participants and generating "Co-authored-by" comments for easy credit in the commit message—perfect for acknowledging reviewers and commenters, not just code contributors.
