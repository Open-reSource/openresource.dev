# Contributing to Open {re}Source

Looking to contribute something to Open {re}Source? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.


## Using the Issue Tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Open-reSource/openresource.dev/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests), [content](#content) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. [Our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Open-reSource/discussions) or [Discord channel](/README.md#community) are better places to get help.

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

- Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

## Issues and Labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `bug` - Issues in the website itself.
- `content` - Issues asking for new content in the website in the guide or in the articles.
- `feature` - Issues asking for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified.
- `help wanted` - Issues we need or would love help from the community to resolve.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/Open-reSource/openresource.dev/labels).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

1. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `main` in the repository.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Content

Content requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this content. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any **significant** pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project. For trivial things, or things that don't require a lot of your time, you can go ahead and make a PR.

**Do not create a Pull Request with new content.** New content in the guide (modules or chapters) or in the articles are provided only by the core team.

**However**, if existing content can be improved, Pull Requests are welcome! Notice that in this case, this work is going to be licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/openresource.dev.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd openresource.dev
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-reSource/openresource.dev.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please try to respect the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description against the `main` branch.
